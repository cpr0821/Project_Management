# Project_Management
This is a group of documents that I put together with a group of 4 others to manage a project at our fabricated company "Automated Systems"

This includes:
  Statement of Work (SOW)
  Project Management Plan (PMP)
  Stakeholder Analyis/Mapping
  Risk/Actions/Issues/Decisions (RAID)
  Dashboard (Status Reports)
  Microsoft Project Schedule (MPP)
  
I was the lead for the second half of the semester. We pushed the project from 25% to 50% to 75% progression. I finalized the MPP, Stakeholder information, Status Reports and the Risk Management Plan. I also contributed to the RAID and the SOW and PMP.
