# Project_Management
This is a group of documents that I put together with a group of 4 others to manage a project at our fabricated company "Automated Systems"

This includes:
<ul>
  <li>Statement of Work (SOW) </li>
  <li>Project Management Plan (PMP)</li>
  <li>Stakeholder Analyis/Mapping</li>
  <li>Risk/Actions/Issues/Decisions (RAID)</li>
  <li>Dashboard (Status Reports)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Project Schedule (MPP)</li>
</ul>  

I was the lead for the second half of the semester. We pushed the project from 25% to 50% to 75% progression. I finalized the MPP, Stakeholder information, Status Reports and the Risk Management Plan. I also contributed to the RAID and the SOW and PMP.
